# Decoding-penetrating-attacks
As part of an investigation into a major attack that occurred several months ago, a computer belonging to one of the attackers was found, which turned out to that he is part of a large group of hackers.
The computer contained software apparently belonging to the same group to which the attacker belonged, which displays the number of attacks
designed by them in all countries of the world.
To understand the program, I tried researching its protocol(that was the first part).
In the second phase of the research, after understanding the protocol, I contacted the software's server then, I created a dashbord.
This panel showed the user information about the attacks that would take place in the country he entered, as well as additional information.
In the last part of the project I worked with the CMD in order to eliminate existing attacks and prevent future attacks using the protocol I discovered.
